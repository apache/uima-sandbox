2. Installation and Setup

2.1 Supported Platforms

UIMA EE Requires Java 5 or later.  It has been tested with Sun Java 5 on Windows XP and Linux.
Other platforms and Java (5+) implementations should work, but have not been significantly tested.

2.2. Environment Variables
After you have unpacked the UIMA EE UIMA distribution, you must perform the following
environment variable settings (the same as for normal Apache UIMA setup):

    * Set JAVA_HOME to the directory of your JRE installation you would like to use for UIMA.
    * Set UIMA_HOME to the uima-ee directory of your unpacked Apache UIMA distribution
    * Append UIMA_HOME/bin to your PATH

2.3 Running the Setup Script
Also, you must run the script UIMA_HOME/bin/setupUimaEE.bat (or .sh).  This does two things:
    1) It downloads several open-source packages required by UIMA EE.  During this process
       you will be informed about the license for each package and asked to confirm that
       you want to proceed to download the software.
    2) It runs the standard UIMA adjustExamplePaths script to update
        paths in the examples based on the actual UIMA_HOME directory path.

    Note: The Mac OS X operating system has special procedures for setting up global environment
    variables; see http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1067.html for how to do this.

2.4 Setting up Eclipse
Eclipse users should install the UIMA Eclipse Plugins and UIMA Examples Project using the "manual"
install procedure described in Chapter 3 of the Apache UIMA Overview and Setup guide 
(docs/pdf/overview_and_setup.pdf). The manual procedure is required to pick up capability to
work with UIMA EE deployment descriptors.

However, since UIMA EE requires Java 5, you must be sure to set up your uimaj-examples Eclipse
project to use a version 5 JRE, and you must set your compiler compliance level to 5.0.  To do
this go to Window->Preferences and navigate to the Java->Compiler page.


3. Getting Started

3.1 Starting the ActiveMQ Broker
UIMA EE services require an ActiveMQ broker to be available with which to create/register 
the service request queue. If no broker is available, start a new broker on the same machine 
the services will run on or another machine; this is done by first setting an env parameter
ACTIVEMQ_BASE pointing at a writable directory, or simply by cd'ing to a writable directory,
and running:

   startBroker.sh/bat

Before the broker is started, if necessary, $ACTIVEMQ_BASE (or "./amq") will be created 
and default configuration files will be copied there. The configuration files can then be 
customized to modify broker behavior for subsequent startups.

Note: only one broker can be started at a time on the same machine with the same
      configuration file, or on different machines from the same writable directory.

When the broker starts it will print a message such as:
  INFO TransportServerThreadSupport - Listening for connections at: tcp://yourHost:61616

Note this URL since you will need it to run services and clients.

The tcp protocol is used to connect to brokers that are listening on an exposed port.
To connect to brokers running behind a firewall, see section 3.6 below for instructions
on using HTTP tunneling.


3.2 Deploying an Analysis Engine as a UIMA EE Asynchronous Service

a. Create a Deployment Descriptor.
  Examples can be found in the examples/deploy/ee directory,
  and the syntax is documented in docs/pdf/uima_async_scaleout.pdf.
  One of the things that the deployment descriptor contains is the URL of the broker,
  which must match the URL of the broker you started in step 3.1 (note that if running
  everything on the same node, you can substitute "localhost" for the actual host name).
  The examples assume the broker is listening on tcp://localhost:61616.

b. Run the command:

     deployAsyncService.sh/cmd testDD.xml

  The argument to the command is the deployment descriptor you created in step (a).

  Note: If you use import by name in your deployment descriptor, UIMA EE searches the CLASSPATH
  as well as directories on UIMA_DATAPATH to resolve the import.

  Note: This command will generate an intermediate file in the working directory,
  with a filename derived from your deployment descriptor name (e.g., testDD_spring.xml).
  This file is used internally by UIMA EE and is automatically regenerated each time
  you run.


3.3 Calling a UIMA EE Asynchronous Service
To test a remote UIMA service you can use the script:
  runRemoteAsyncAE.sh/cmd brokerUrl endpoint [-c CollectionReaderDescriptorFile] \
    [-d DeploymentDescriptorFile]+ [-w ReplyWindow] [-o OutputDir] [-t Timeout] [-i]

  This connects to a remote AE at specified brokerUrl and endpoint (which must match
  the inputQueue endpoint in the remote AE service's deployment descriptor).

  The following optional arguments are accepted:
    -c  Specifies a CollectionReader descriptor.  The client will read CASes from the
        CollectionReader and send them to the service for processing.  If this option
        is omitted, one empty CAS will be sent to the service (useful for services
        containing a CAS Multiplier acting as a collection reader).

    -d  Specifies a deployment descriptor. The specified service will be deployed before processing
        begins, and the service will be undeployed after processing completes. 
        Multiple -d entries can be given.

    -w  Specifies a "ReplyWindow", which is the maximum number of outstanding requests
        that the client will send. This is only meaningful if the -c option is also used.
        If not specified, the default window size is 5.

    -o  Specifies an Output Directory.  All CASes received by the client's
        CallbackListener will be serialized to XMI in the specified OutputDir.
        If omitted, no XMI files will be output.

    -t  Specifies a timeout period in seconds.  If a CAS does not return within this time
        period it is considered an error. By default there is no timeout, so the client will
        wait forever.

    -i  Causes the client to ignore errors returned from the service.  If not specified, the
        client terminates on the first error.

The source code for this client is provided in

  examples/src/org/apache/uima/examples/ee/RunRemoteAsyncAE.java

and you can also run this class from the uimaj-examples Eclipse project.


3.4 Quick Test of an async service

Start two terminal windows, each with an environments setup as described in section 2.2.

  * In the first terminal window start the broker (as described in section 3.1),
    by running the command:
      startBroker.sh/bat

  * In the second terminal window, launch a service from the deployment descriptor
    Deploy_MeetingDetectorTAE.xml and run the test driver:
      cd $UIMA_HOME/examples/deploy/ee
      runRemoteAsyncAE.sh/cmd tcp://localhost:61616 MeetingDetectorTaeQueue \
         -d Deploy_MeetingDetectorTAE.xml \
         -c $UIMA_HOME/examples/descriptors/collection_reader/FileSystemCollectionReader.xml

    If you get an UnsupportedClassVersionError, Java 5 is probably not being used.
    If the driver fails to find the input data, setupUimaEE was probably not run.


3.5 Calling a UIMA EE Asynchronous Service from an Existing UIMA Application

You can also call a UIMA EE Service from the DocumentAnalyzer or any other UIMA
application using a new JMS client. However, note that this is a synchronous interface,
that is, it will process only one CAS at a time, so it will not take advantage of the
scalability that UIMA EE provides.  To process more than one CAS at a
time, you must use the Asynchronous UIMA EE Client as described in section 3.3.

An example JMS client service descriptor is provided in

  examples/descriptors/ee/MeetingDetectorAsyncAE.xml

The JMS service makes use of the customResourceSpecifier capability in Apache UIMA.
For more information on the customResourceSpecifier see the "Custom Resource Specifiers"
section in the Apache UIMA Reference manual.


3.6 Firewalls between clients and services

A service accessed behind a firewall can be accessed as long as its input queue
is on a broker that is accessable. For example, the service can register with an
accessable broker running outside the firewall.

By default, the reply queue used by an aggregate when calling a remote delegate is located
on the host where the aggregate is running. This will not work if there is a firewall blocking
the service from replying to this reply queue, or any other reason that the symbolic or actual IP
address of the aggregate's host is not accessable by the service.

There are two ways to fix this problem, the easiest being to specify that the reply queue 
should be created on the service's broker. This is done by adding
   <replyQueue location="remote"/>
to the remoteAnalysisEngine definition for the remote delegate.

The client API used by runRemoteAsyncAE always creates a reply queue on the service's broker.
These "remote" reply queues are now JMS temporary queues, which means that they will be
deleted when the requestor aggregate or client API terminates.

A more complicated approach is for the client to use an HTTP connector. In this case
UIMA EE always creates reply queues on the service's broker.

Note: There are bugs in the ActiveMQ HTTP connector. A fix is available if you want to
      build ActiveMQ manually. See http://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1308
      

3.7 Monitoring a broker and its queues

When the broker starts it will print a message such as:
  INFO  ManagementContext  - JMX consoles can connect to service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi

Connect a JMX console to this service with:
         $JAVA_HOME/bin/jconsole service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi
If your console is not on the same machine as the broker replace localhost by
the name of the broker's machine.  For more details see http://activemq.apache.org/jmx.html


4. Known problems with Release 0.6.5

  1. Only one remote CAS multiplier per aggregate is supported.
  2. The thresholdWindow feature is not working and should not be specified.

Disclaimer
-----------

Apache UIMA is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily
a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does
indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
