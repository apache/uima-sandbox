For general instructions about building the Apache UIMA annotator package 
please refer to:
http://incubator.apache.org/uima/svn.html#building.with.maven

For details about how to build the current source package refer the 
steps below:

1) cd to the SandboxDistr/annotator-package project, and do mvn install
2) To work with eclipse additionally do mvn eclipse:eclipse
3) To build the distribution, follow the setup instructions on
http://incubator.apache.org/uima/svn.html#build.distribution and 
then cd to SandboxDistr/annotator-package and do mvn assembly:assembly

-------------------------

If you have installed both the Apache UIMA annotator package binary 
distribution and the Apache UIMA annotator package source distribution, 
you can run the addSourceJars.bat (or .sh) script to add the 
source code to the jar files in the UIMA_HOME/lib directory.  
This may make it more convenient to access
the UIMA Source Code (and JavaDocs) from an IDE such as Eclipse.

See the NOTICE file for licensing information.

Apache UIMA is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily
a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does
indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
