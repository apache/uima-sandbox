     Apache UIMA Asynchronous Scaleout (UIMA-AS) Version 2.2.2 README
     ----------------------------------------------------------------

0. Changes in the 2.2.2 release
  - Development has been moved to Apache, in the Apache UIMA incubator project
  - Package names are changed to org.apache.uima...
  - Name has been changed to Apache UIMA Asynchronous Scaleout (Apache UIMA-AS)
  - Versioning aligned with Apache UIMA
  - Build process changed to use Maven


1. Contents of Apache UIMA-AS binary distribution

The Apache UIMA-AS binary distribution includes 
  - Apache UIMA (exluding documentation) 
  - Apache UIMA Asynchronous Scaleout extensions
  - Saxon
  - Apache ActiveMQ
  - Spring Framework

UIMA-AS components include:

  bin/startBroker.sh/bat: starts the ActiveMQ broker, which must be running before
      UIMA AS services can be deployed.
  bin/deployAsyncService.sh/bat: deploys an AnalysisEngine as a UIMA-AS
      service.  Takes one or more UIMA-AS Deployment Descriptors as arguments.
  bin/runRemoteAsyncAE.sh/bat: Calls a UIMA-AS service. Takes arguments specifying the
      location of the service, and an optional CollectionReader descriptor file used to
      obtain the CASes to be processed by the service.

  docs/pdf/uima_async_scaleout.pdf: UIMA-AS documentation, including the specification
      for the deployment descriptor file syntax.

  examples/deploy/as/...  (Sample Deployment Descriptors)
    Deploy_RoomNumberAnnotator.xml: Deploys Room Number Annotator Primitive AE
    Deploy_MeetingDetectorTAE.xml: Deploys Meeting Detector Aggregate AE with all
        delegates in the same JVM.
    Deploy_MeetingDetectorTAE_Whiteboard.xml: Deploys Meeting Detector Aggregate AE
        using the whiteboard Flow Controller.

        Service from an existing UIMA application; see Section 2.5 below.


2. Installation and Setup

2.1 Supported Platforms

UIMA AS Requires Java 5 or later.  It has been tested with Sun Java 5 on Windows XP and Linux.
Other platforms and Java (5+) implementations should work, but have not been significantly tested.

2.2. Environment Variables

After you have unpacked the UIMA AS UIMA distribution, you must perform the following
environment variable settings (the same as for normal Apache UIMA setup):

    * Set JAVA_HOME to the directory of your JRE installation you would like to use for UIMA.
    * Set UIMA_HOME to the apache-uima-as directory of your unpacked Apache UIMA distribution
    * Append UIMA_HOME/bin to your PATH

    Note: The Mac OS X operating system has special procedures for setting up global environment
    variables; see http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1067.html for how to do this.

2.3 Running the Setup Script

You must run the script UIMA_HOME/bin/adjustExamplePaths.bat (or .sh).  This updates
paths in the examples based on the actual UIMA_HOME directory path.

2.4 Setting up Eclipse

Eclipse users should install the UIMA Eclipse Plugins and UIMA Examples Project using the "manual"
install procedure described in Chapter 3 of the Apache UIMA Overview and Setup guide 
(docs/pdf/overview_and_setup.pdf). The manual procedure is required to pick up capability to
work with UIMA AS deployment descriptors.

However, since UIMA AS requires Java 5, you must be sure to set up your uimaj-examples Eclipse
project to use a version 5 (or later) JRE, and you must set your compiler compliance level to 5.0.  To do
this go to Window->Preferences and navigate to the Java->Compiler page.  Remember to 
run the base Eclipse using Java 5 (or later), as well.


3. Getting Started

3.1 Starting the ActiveMQ Broker

UIMA AS services require an ActiveMQ broker to be available with which to create/register 
the service request queue. If no broker is available, start a new broker on the same machine 
the services will run on or another machine; this is done by first setting an env parameter
ACTIVEMQ_BASE pointing at a writable directory, or simply by cd'ing to a writable directory,
and running:

   startBroker.sh/bat

The first time run this script will create a new directory $ACTIVEMQ_BASE/amq (or ./amq)
and default configuration files will be copied there. The configuration files can then be 
customized to modify broker behavior for subsequent startups.

Note: only one broker can be started at a time on the same machine with the same
      configuration file, or on different machines from the same writable directory.

When the broker starts it will print a message such as:
  INFO: Listening for connections at: tcp://yourHostname:61616

Note this URL since you will need it to run services and clients.

The tcp listening port must be exposed to any clients or services using the broker.
To connect to a broker running behind a firewall using HTTP tunneling, see section 3.6 below.

3.2 Deploying an Analysis Engine as a UIMA AS Asynchronous Service

a. Create a Deployment Descriptor.
  Examples can be found in the examples/deploy/as directory,
  and the syntax is documented in docs/pdf/uima_async_scaleout.pdf.
  One of the things that the deployment descriptor contains is the URL of the broker,
  which must match the URL of the broker you started in step 3.1 (note that if running
  everything on the same node, you can substitute "localhost" for the actual host name).
  The examples assume the broker is listening on tcp://localhost:61616.

b. Run the command:

     deployAsyncService.sh/cmd [testDD.xml]

  The argument to the command is the deployment descriptor you created in step (a).

  Note: If you use import by name in your deployment descriptor, UIMA AS searches the CLASSPATH
  as well as directories on UIMA_DATAPATH to resolve the import.

3.3 Calling a UIMA AS Asynchronous Service

To test a remote UIMA service you can use the script:
  runRemoteAsyncAE.sh/cmd brokerUrl endpoint

  This connects to a remote AE at specified brokerUrl and endpoint (which must match
  the inputQueue endpoint in the remote AE service's deployment descriptor).

  A subset of the optional arguments to runRemoteAsyncAE are:
    -c  Specifies a CollectionReader descriptor.  The client will obtain CASes from the
        CollectionReader and send them to the service for processing.  If this option
        is omitted, one empty CAS will be sent to the service (useful for services
        containing a CAS Multiplier acting as a collection reader).

    -d  Specifies a deployment descriptor. The specified service will be deployed before processing
        begins, and the service will be undeployed after processing completes. 
        Multiple -d entries can be given.

    -o  Specifies an Output Directory.  All CASes received by the client's
        CallbackListener will be serialized to XMI in the specified OutputDir.
        If omitted, no XMI files will be output.
        
  The full set of arguments are documented if you type the command with no arguments.

3.4 Quick Test of an async service

Start two terminal windows, each with an environments setup as described in section 2.2.

  * In the first terminal window start the broker (as described in section 3.1),
    by running the commands:
      cd some-writable-directory     
      startBroker.sh/bat

  * In the second terminal window, deploy a sample service and send it some CASes:
      cd $UIMA_HOME/examples/deploy/as
      runRemoteAsyncAE.sh/cmd tcp://localhost:61616 MeetingDetectorTaeQueue \
         -d Deploy_MeetingDetectorTAE.xml \
         -c $UIMA_HOME/examples/descriptors/collection_reader/FileSystemCollectionReader.xml

    If you get an UnsupportedClassVersionError, Java 5 is probably not being used.
    If the driver fails to find the input data, adjustExamplePaths was probably not run.

3.5 Calling a UIMA AS Asynchronous Service from an Existing UIMA Application

You can also call a UIMA AS Service from the DocumentAnalyzer or any other UIMA
application using a new JMS client. However, note that this is a synchronous interface,
that is, it will process only one CAS at a time, so it will not take advantage of the
scalability that UIMA AS provides.  To process more than one CAS at a
time, you must use the Asynchronous UIMA AS Client as described in section 3.3.

An example JMS client service descriptor is provided in

  examples/descriptors/as/MeetingDetectorAsyncAE.xml

The JMS service makes use of the customResourceSpecifier capability in Apache UIMA.
For more information on the customResourceSpecifier see the "Custom Resource Specifiers"
section in the Apache UIMA Reference manual.

3.6 Firewalls between clients and services

A service running behind a firewall can be accessed as long as its input queue
is on a broker that is accessable. For example, the service can register with a
public broker running outside the firewall.

By default, the reply queue used by an aggregate when calling a remote delegate is located
on the host where the aggregate is running. This will not work if there is a firewall blocking
the service from replying to this reply queue, or any other reason that the symbolic or actual IP
address of the aggregate's host is not accessable by the service.

There are two ways to fix this problem, the easiest being to specify that the reply queue 
should be created on the service's broker. This is done by adding
   <replyQueue location="remote"/>
to the remoteAnalysisEngine definition for the remote delegate.

The client API used by runRemoteAsyncAE always creates a reply queue on the service's broker.
These "remote" reply queues are JMS temporary queues, which means that they will be
deleted when the client aggregate or application terminates.

A more complicated approach is for the client to use an HTTP connector. In this case
UIMA AS always creates reply queues on the service's broker.

Note: There are bugs in the standard ActiveMQ HTTP connector core librarys (which we have
      patched) associated with CASes larger than 64KB
      and with doublebyte characters. The ActiveMQ jars distributed with UIMA AS
      include the bug fixes described in http://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1308
      
3.7 Monitoring a broker and its queues

When the broker starts it will print a message such as:
  INFO  ManagementContext  - JMX consoles can connect to service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi

Connect a JMX console to this service with:
         $JAVA_HOME/bin/jconsole service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi
         
(Note: jconsole is available in Java SDK (not JRE) distributions from Sun)         
If your console is not on the same machine as the broker replace localhost by
the name of the broker's machine.  For more details see http://activemq.apache.org/jmx.html


4. Migration from CPM to UIMA-AS

Migrating a collection processing engine from the CPM to UIMA-AS is straightforward.

First, migrate the CPE descriptor to a standard UIMA aggregate descriptor:  
create a UIMA aggregate that includes all the components specified in the CPE descriptor. 
Transfer any parameter overrides in the CPE descriptor to the aggregate descriptor.
Note that the aggreate descriptor must set <multipleDeploymentAllowed> to false 
to be consistent with collection reader and CAS consumer delegates.

Second, test this aggregate descriptor by instantiating the aggregate and sending it a single CAS.
The contents of the CAS are not important; its purpose is to start the collection reader delegate
which will then create the actual CASes to be processed by the other aggregate components.
The CAS Visual Debugger, CVD, is a useful tool for doing this test.

Next, create a UIMA-AS deployment descriptor that specifies desired scaleout and error handling.
Vinci services are still supported, although it is recommended to replace them with UIMA-AS
services to enable more efficient load balancing and greater scaleout capability.

An example of this kind of migration is embodied by the sample descriptors:
  Original:  
     $UIMA_HOME/examples/descriptors/collection_processing_engine/MeetingFinderCPE_Integrated.xml
  Migrated:
     $UIMA_HOME/examples/deploy/as/MeetingFinderAggregate.xml
     $UIMA_HOME/examples/deploy/as/Deploy_MeetingFinder.xml


5. Known problems/limitations with Release 2.2.2

  1. Remote CAS multiplier support is limited to a single, AS Primitive service.
  2. No automatic refresh for broken connections with temp reply queues.

Disclaimer
-----------

Apache UIMA is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily
a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does
indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
