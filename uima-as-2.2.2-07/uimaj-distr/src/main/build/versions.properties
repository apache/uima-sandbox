#   UIMA Version strings
#
# Unlike other Ant property assignments, in the case of 
# duplicates, the last one wins.
# So - don't have duplicate values in this file
#
# A set consists of 
#   a) what the new values should be
#   b) what the previous values were 
#
#      The previous values are used to compare against, to find
#      the string to replace.
