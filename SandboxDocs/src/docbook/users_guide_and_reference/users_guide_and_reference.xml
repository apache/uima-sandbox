        <title>Incubation Notice and Disclaimer</title>
        <para>Apache UIMA is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). 
          Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that 
          the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner 
          consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily 
          a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, 
          it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</para>
