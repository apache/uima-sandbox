    The Apache UIMA Sandbox is a place where additional, optional components to Apache UIMA are
    developed.  These components are of varying degrees of maturity.  Some may be quite solid, but
    haven't made it into the core yet, for various reasons.  Others may still be under construction.
    Please check the documentatio for the specific project for the developers' assessment of the
    state of the code.
