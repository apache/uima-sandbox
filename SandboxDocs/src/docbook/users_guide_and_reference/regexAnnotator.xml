	<title>Regular Expression Annotator</title>

	<para>
		The Regular Expression Annotator (RegexAnnotator) is an Apache
		UIMA analysis engine that detects entities based on regular
		expressions or concepts. A regular expression describe precise
		patterns that are looked for in the document text. A concepts in
		the current sense is a set of regular expressions that work
		together to detect a more complex entity. The defined regular
		expressions or concepts are used to detect entities like
		numbers, email addresses or URLs and create annotations for
		them.
	</para>

	<section id="sandbox.regexAnnotator.processingOverview">
		<title>Processing Overview</title>
		<para>
			To detect entities the RegexAnnotator must be configured
			using an external XML file. We call this file concepts file
			since it contains the concepts and regular expression rules
			that the annotator use to detect the entities. This
			configuration contains additional to the rules and concepts
			also the annotations that should be created if an entity was
			found in the document text. The types and features used to
			create the annotations must be defined in the UIMA type
			system.
		</para>
		<para>
			After the configuration is done, the RegexAnnotator is ready
			to use. During is initialization is reads the concepts file
			and checks if all rules and concepts are valid and if all
			annotations types are defined. If no error exists the
			processing can start. During the processing the rules are
			processed in the same order as defined in the concepts xml
			document. The results of a preceding rule can be used for
			the following one.

		<title>Concepts Configuration File</title>
		<para>
			The RegexAnnotator can be configured using two levels of
			complexity.
		</para>
		<para>
			The RuleSet definition is the simple way to define rules
			that can consists of a regular expression pattern and of
			annotations that should be created if the rules match an
			entity.
		</para>
		<para>
			The Concept definition is the more complex way to define
			rules that consists of more than one regular expression rule
			that are combined together.
		</para>
		<para>
			The syntax in both definitions is the same, so you don't
			need to learn two configuration possibilities it is just to
			have an easier way to configure the annotator for simpler
			entities. Furthermore it is possible to extend the RuleSet
			definition with more and more features so that it becomes a
			real Concept definition.

				The RuleSet definition above defines are simple concept

				matches for the pattern are used to create the
				annotations defined in the
				<code>&lt;createAnnotations></code>

				org.apache.uima.MyAnnotation annotation is created that

			<para>
				As you can see the concept definition is a more complex
				RuleSet definition. The main differences are the ruleID
				and confidence features for a rule. If these features
				are specified, the feature values can be used as
				annotation feature values when the
				org.apache.uima.MyAnnotation1 is created. But lets see
				how these concept is processed.
			</para>
			<para>
				The concept processing depends on a parameter setting
				for the RegexAnnotator. The parameter to control the
				processing is called
				<code>ProcessAllConceptRules</code>
				. By default this parameter is set to
				<code>false</code>
				what means that the concept processing starts with the
				first rule. If this rule found any match that triggers
				to create an annotation the concept processing stops and
				the other rules are not used. If the first rule doesn't
				find a match, the next rule is used. This strategy is
				used until a annotation is found or all rules are
				processed. If the parameter
				<code>ProcessAllConceptRules</code>
				is set to
				<code>true</code>
				all rules are processed independent of the matches of a
				rule.
			</para>
			<para>
				If for a rule an annotations is created that has a
				<code>&lt;setFeature></code>
				definition of type
				<code>Confidence</code>
				or
				<code>RuleId</code>
				the current ruleId and confidence value of the rule is
				added as feature value to the created annotations. Doing
				this helps you after the text is processed to make
				reliable statements about the confidence of your
				annotation.
			</para>
			<note>
				<para>
					The features for
					<code>Confidence</code>
					and
					<code>RuleId</code>
					must be defined by yourself in the UIMA type system.
					So you can also assign the confidence or ruleId to
					any other feature you have defined in the UIMA type
					system. Confidence features have to be of type
					uima.cas.Float and RuleId features have to be of
					type uima.cas.String.

					When analyzing the text you will get a car brand annotation since "Ford" is
					a car brand. But is this behavior correct? The work around that issue
					you can create an exception that looks like
					 <programlisting><![CDATA[
<ruleExceptions>	
  <exception matchType="uima.SentenceAnnotation">Henry</exception>

				  output types and features declared in the <code>&lt;annotation></code> elements of the concept file.
				  For example the <code>org.apache.uima.TestAnnot</code> annotation and the 
				  <code>org.apache.uima.TestAnnot:testFeature</code> feature used below must
				  be added to the output capability section in the RegexAnnotator descriptor.

				  If there are any language dependent rules in the concept file the supported languages abbreviations 
				  have to be specified in the <code>&lt;languagesSupported></code>element. If there are no 
				  language dependent rules available you can specify <code>x-unspecified</code> as language. That means
				  that the annotator can work on all languages.

				  descriptor looks like:
