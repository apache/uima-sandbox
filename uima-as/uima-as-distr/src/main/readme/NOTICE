The contents of the downloaded file (saxon[version].zip) are subject to 
the Mozilla Public License Version 1.0 (the "License"); you may not use 
this file except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy

for the specific language governing rights and limitations under the License.

The Original Code of Saxon comprises all those components which are not 
explicitly attributed to other parties.

The Initial Developer of the Original Code is Michael Kay. Until February 
2001 Michael Kay was an employee of International Computers Limited (now 
part of Fujitsu Limited), and original code developed during that time was 
released under this license by permission from International Computers 
Limited. From February 2001 until February 2004 Michael Kay was an employee 
of Software AG, and code developed during that time was released under this 
license by permission from Software AG, acting as a "Contributor". 
Subsequent code has been developed by Saxonica Limited, of which Michael Kay 
is a Director, again acting as a "Contributor". A small number of modules, 
or enhancements to modules, have been developed by other individuals (either 
written specially for Saxon, or incorporated into Saxon having initially been 
released as part of another open source product). Such contributions are 
acknowledged individually in comments attached to the relevant code modules. 
All Rights Reserved.

If you produce a product that includes or requires Saxon, please refer to it 
prominently as "The Saxon XSLT and XQuery Processor from Saxonica Limited", 
and include the URL of the home page, which is at http://www.saxonica.com/. 
As a courtesy, please take reasonable steps to ensure that your users know 
that they are running Saxon.

There is no guarantee of technical support, though I am usually able to answer 
enquiries within a few days. Please subscribe to the mailing list available at 
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help and raise any enquiries 
there. Also check the Saxon project pages on SourceForge for details of known 
errors; all bugs are listed there as soon as I have sufficient evidence to 
describe the nature of the problem.

Other components

Saxon includes the org.apache.xerces.util.XMLChar module from the Apache 
Xerces product, renamed as net.sf.saxon.om.XMLChar but otherwise unchanged. 
See the copyright statements included in the source code of that module for
conditions of use.

Saxon includes code for performing Unicode normalization that is derived 
from the sample code published for this purpose by the Unicode consortium. 
For the terms of use of this code, see http://www.unicode.org/terms_of_use.html, 
which should be regarded as forming part of these conditions of use, and part 
of the Saxon documentation. The original code and data published by Unicode 
Inc has been modified in the following ways: (a) two bugs have been fixed 
(these have been reported to the originator), (b) the routines for extracting 
data from the Unicode character database have been rewritten so that the 
required subset of the data is precompiled into Saxon, for efficiency, (c) 
dependencies on the ICU software from IBM have been removed, replacing 
calls to the relevant routines by calls to utility functions within Saxon 
itself, (d) package names have been changed, (e) redundant code has been 
removed.
