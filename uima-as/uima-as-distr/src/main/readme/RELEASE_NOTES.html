     <p>
  			UIMA Asynchronous Scaleout (AS) is an add-on to Apache UIMA that provides a set of capabilities
for achieving flexible scaleout.  It is a second generation design, replacing the
CPM and Vinci Services. The CPM and Vinci are still available and are not being deprecated, 
but new designs are encouraged to use UIMA-AS for scalability, and current designs 
reaching limitations may want to move to UIMA-AS.

			</p>
                                                <p>
				UIMA-AS is integrated with the new flow controller architecture, and can be applied to
both primitive and aggregate analysis engines.
