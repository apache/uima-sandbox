		<title>Introduction</title>
		<para>
			The Regular Expression Annotator (RegexAnnotator) is an
			Apache UIMA analysis engine that detects entities such as
			email addresses, URLs, phone numbers, zip codes or any other
			entity that can be specified using a regular expression. For
			each entity that is detected an own annotation can be
			created or an already existing annotation can be updated
			with new features.

			To detect also more difficult and complex entities, the
			annotator provides some advanced filter capabilities and a
			rule definition syntax that can combine rules to a concept
			with a confidence value for each of the concept's rules.
		</para>

	<chapter id="sandbox.regexAnnotator.processingOverview">
		<title>Processing Overview</title>
		<para>
			To detect any kind of entity the RegexAnnotator must be
			configured using an external XML file. We call this file
			"concept file" since it contains the regular expressions and
			concepts that the annotator use during its processing to
			detect entities. In addition to the rules the concept file
			also contains the "entity result processing" that is done if
			an entity was detected. The "entity result processing" can
			either be the creation of new annotations or an update of an
			existing annotation with additional features. The types and
			features that are used to create new annotations have to be
			available in the UIMA type system.
		</para>
		<para>
			After the concept file is created, the annotator XML
			descriptor have to be updated with the capabilities and
			maybe with the type system information from the concept
			file. The capability update is necessary that the UIMA
			framework can call the annotator also in complex annotator
			flows if the annotator is assembled with others to an
			analysis bundle. The UIMA type system update is only
			necessary if the used types are not available in the UIMA
			type system definition.
		</para>
		<para>
			With the completion of the descriptor updates, the
			RegexAnnotator is ready to use. When starting the annotator,
			during the initialization the annotator reads the concept
			file and checks if all rules and concepts are valid and if
			all annotations types are defined in the UIMA type system.
			For each document that is processed the rules and concepts
			are executed in exactly the same order as defined in the
			concept file. The results and annotations created for a
			preceding rule are used by the following one since they are
			stored in the CAS.
		</para>

		<title>Concepts Configuration File</title>
		<para>
			The RegexAnnotator can be configured using two levels of
			complexity.
		</para>
		<para>
			The RuleSet definition is the easier way to define rules.
			Such a definition consists of a regular expression pattern
			and of annotations that should be created if the rule match
			an entity.
		</para>
		<para>
			The Concept definition is the more complex way to define
			rules. Such a definition can consists of more than one
			regular expression rule that can be combined together and of
			a set of annotations that should be created if one of the
			rules has matched an entity.
		</para>
		<para>
			The syntax for both definitions is the same, so you don't
			need to learn two configuration possibilities. The RuleSet
			definition is just available to have an easier and faster
			way to configure the annotator for simple tasks. If you have
			a RuleSet definition it is also possible to extend it with
			more and more features so that it becomes a real Concept
			definition.
		</para>

				The syntax of a simple RuleSet definition for the
				RegexAnnotator is shown in the listing below:

				The definition above defines are simple concept
				with the name <code>RuleSetDefinitionExample</code>. The 
				defined rule use the <code>ExamplePattern</code> as 
				regular expression pattern that is matched on the
				covered text of the match type <code>uima.tcas.DocumentAnnotation</code>. 
				As match strategy, <code>matchAll</code> is used that means that all
				matches for the pattern are used to create the
				annotations defined in the
				<code>&lt;createAnnotations></code>
				element. So for each match a
				<code>org.apache.uima.MyAnnotation</code> annotation is created that
				covers the match in the document text.

			</para>
			<para>
				As you can see the Concept definition is a more complex
				RuleSet definition. The main differences are some additional
				features defined at the rule and the combination of rules 
				within one concept. 
				The new features for a rule are <code>ruleID</code>
				and <code>confidence</code>. If these features
				are specified, the feature values for these features can 
				later be assigned to an annotation feature for a created annotation. 
				In case we use the listing above as example this means that when the 
				<code>org.apache.uima.MyAnnotation</code> is created the value of the
				<code>confidence</code> feature of the rule that matched the document text 
				is assigned to the annotation feature called <code>confidenceValue</code>.
				The same is done for the <code>ruleId</code> feature.
				With that you can later check your annotation confidence and you can see 
				which rule was responsible for the annotation creation.
			</para>
			<note>
				<para>
					The annotation features for <code>Confidence</code>
					and <code>RuleId</code>
					have to be created manually in the UIMA type system.
					Given that it is possible to assign the <code>confidence</code> and <code>ruleId</code> 
					feature values to any other annotation feature you have defined 
					in the UIMA type system. Confidence features have to be of type
					<code>uima.cas.Float</code> and RuleId features have to be of
					type <code>uima.cas.String</code>.
				</para>
			</note>
			
			<para>
				The processing of a concept definition depends on a parameter setting
				that can be changed in the RegexAnnotator descriptor. 
				The parameter that controls the processing is called
				<code>ProcessAllConceptRules</code>.
				By default this parameter is set to	<code>false</code>. 
				This means that the concept processing 
				starts with the	first rule and goes on with the next one 
				until a match was found. So in this processing mode, maybe only the first rule
				of a concept is evaluated if there a match was found. The other rules
				of this concept will be ignored in that case.
				This strategy should be used for example if your first concept 
				rule has a strict pattern with a confidence of 1.0 and your 
				second rule has a more lenient pattern with a confidence
				of 0.5. If the <code>ProcessAllConceptRules</code> parameter
				is set to <code>true</code>	all rules of a concept are processed 
				independent of the matches for a previous rule.

			<title>Annotator Descriptor</title>
			<para>The RegexAnnotator analysis engine descriptor contains some processing information for 
			the annotator. The processing information is specified as configuration parameters. 
			This chapter we explain in detail the possible descriptor settings.

			<section id="sandbox.regexAnnotator.annotatorDescriptor.configParam">
				<title>Configuration Parameters</title>
				<para>
				  The RegexAnnotator has the following configuration parameters that can affect the processing: 
				</para>
				<para>
					<itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								<code>ProcessAllConceptRules</code>
								- By default this parameter is set to <code>false</code>. 
								This means that the concept processing
								starts with the	first rule (highest confidence) and goes on with the next one
								until a match was found. So in this processing mode, maybe only the first rule
								of a concept is evaluated if there a match was found. 
								The other rules of this concept will be ignored in that case.
								If the <code>ProcessAllConceptRules</code> parameter
								is set to <code>true</code>	all rules of a concept are processed 
								independent of the matches for a previous rule. 
							</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								<code>ConceptFiles</code>
								- This parameter is modeled as array of Strings and contains 
								the concept files the annotator should use. The concept files
								must be specified using a relative path that is available in the
								UIMA datapath or in the classpath.

			<section id="sandbox.regexAnnotator.annotatorDescriptor.capabilities">
				<title>Capabilities</title>
				<para>
				  In the capabilities section of the RegexAnnotator descriptor the input and output 
				  capabilities and the supported languages have to be defined. 
				</para>
				<para>
				  The input capabilities defined
				  in the descriptor have to comply with the match types used in the concept rule file 
				  that is used. For example the <code>uima.SentenceAnnotation</code> used in the rule
				  below have to be added to the input capability section in the RegexAnnotator descriptor.
				</para>
				<para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[<rules>
  <rule regEx="SampleRegex" matchStrategy="matchAll" 
      matchType="uima.SentenceAnnotation"/>
</rules>
]]></programlisting>
				</para>
				<para>
				  In the output section, all of the annotation types and features created by 
				  the RegexAnnotator have to be specified. These have to match the 
				  output types and features declared in the <code>&lt;annotation></code> elements of the concept file.
				  For example the <code>org.apache.uima.TestAnnot</code> annotation and the 
				  <code>org.apache.uima.TestAnnot:testFeature</code> feature used below have to
				  be added to the output capability section in the RegexAnnotator descriptor. 
				</para>
				<para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[<createAnnotations>
  <annotation type="org.apache.uima.TestAnnot">
    <begin group="0"/>
    <end group="0"/>
    <setFeature name="testFeature" type="String">$0</setFeature>
  </annotation>
</createAnnotations>
]]></programlisting>
				</para>
				<para>
				  If there are any language dependent rules in the concept file the languages abbreviations 
				  have to be specified in the <code>&lt;languagesSupported></code>element. If there are no 
				  language dependent rules available you can specify <code>x-unspecified</code> as language. That means
				  that the annotator can work on all languages.   
				</para>
				<para>
				  For the short examples used above the capabilities section in the RegexAnnotator 
				  descriptor looks like:
				</para>
				<para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[<capabilities>
  <capability>
    <inputs>
