My name is Michael Hinterhofer. When I was 21, I moved out from my
parents' home into my first own appartment in order to study in a 
bigger city. My new home was in Lilienstrasse 1 in 25334 Hamburg. But 
I realized quickly that life in a metropolis wasn't relaxed enough
for me. So I decided to move into a smaller town. Now I'm a tenant 
with an elderly widow. We live in Buergerstrasse 2 in 63737 Heidelberg.
I really like the smalltown flair and my studies at Heidelberg's
notable university.
