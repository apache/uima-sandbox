/**
 * A <code>UimaAsynchronousEngine</code> enables an application to send CASes for analysis
 * to remote UIMA AS service. It provides a high level API and hides the detail of the
 * transport implementation. The UIMA AS Client implementation uses JMS as its transport
 * mechanism. Both synchronous and asynchronous processing is supported. For synchronous
 * processing an application should call {@link #sendAndReceive(CAS)} method. For asynchronous
 * processing the application should call {@link #sendCAS(CAS)} method. Additionally, processing
 * with a client side <code>CollectionReader</code> is supported as well. The application first
 * instantiates and initializes the <code>CollectionReader</code> and registers it via
 * {@link #setCollectionReader(CollectionReads)} method. Once the <code>CollectionReader</code>
 * is registered, and {@link #initialize(Map)} method is called, the application may call
 * {@link #process()} method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This API enables the application to dynamically deploy UIMA AS services that it intends 
 * to use for processing. These services are deployed in a container and are collocated in 
 * the same JVM as the application. The services are considered private and used exclusively 
 * by the application. To deploy "private" services the application calls either 
 * {@link #deploy(String, Map)} {@link #deploy(String[], Map)} 
 * method, where the first parameter is either a single AS deployment descriptor or an 
 * array thereof. The application must deploy its "private" services *before* calling 
 * {@link #initialize(Map)} method. 
 *  
 * <p>
 * The application may stop the UIMA AS client in the middle of processing by calling
 *  {@link #stop()} method.
 *    
 * <p>
 * Listeners can register with the <code>UimaAsynchronousEngine</code> by calling the
 * {@link #addStatusCallbackListener(UimaASStatusCallbackListener)} method. These listeners receive status
 * callbacks during the processing. An exception to that is the synchronous processing via
 * {@link #sendAndReceive(CAS)} method. This method returns either a CAS containing results of
 * analysis or an exception. No callbacks are made while processing CASes synchronously.
 * <p>
 * An application may choose to implement parallelization of the processing, calling either
 * {@link #sendAndReceive(CAS)} or {@link #sendCASCAS)} methods from multiple threads.
 * <p>
