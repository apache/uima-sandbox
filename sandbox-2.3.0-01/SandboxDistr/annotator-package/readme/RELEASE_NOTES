1. What is UIMA?

Unstructured Information Management applications are software systems that 
analyze large volumes of unstructured information in order to discover knowledge
that is relevant to an end user. UIMA is a framework and SDK for developing such
applications. An example UIM application might ingest plain text and identify 
entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or relations, such as 
works-for or located-at. UIMA enables such an application to be decomposed into 
components, for example "language identification" -> 
"language specific segmentation" -> "sentence boundary detection" -> 
"entity detection (person/place names etc.)". Each component must implement 
interfaces defined by the framework and must provide self-describing metadata 
via XML descriptor files. The framework manages these components and the data 
flow between them. Components are written in Java or C++; the data that 
flows between components is designed for efficient mapping between these 
languages. UIMA additionally provides capabilities to wrap components as 
network services, and can scale to very large volumes by replicating processing 
pipelines over a cluster of networked nodes.

Apache UIMA is an Apache-licensed open source implementation of the UIMA 
specification (that specification is, in turn, being developed concurrently by 
a technical committee within OASIS , a standards organization). We invite and 
encourage you to participate in both the implementation and specification 
efforts.

UIMA is a component framework for analysing unstructured content such as text, 
audio and video. It comprises an SDK and tooling for composing and running 
analytic components written in Java and C++, with some support for Perl, 
Python and TCL.

2. What is the Apache UIMA annotator package?

The Apache UIMA annotator package is an add-on package for the base UIMA release.
The add-on package contains annotator components developed for Apache UIMA. The 
add-on package fits the Apache UIMA directory structure and adds a directory 
called "addons/annotator" that contains the following annotator components:
 - DictionaryAnnotator
 - RegularExpressionAnnotator
 - Tagger
 - WhitespaceTokenizer
 - Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) BSFAnnotator
 - ConceptMapper
 - ConfigurableFeatureExtractor
 - Lucas - an interface to using UIMA with Lucene
 - OpenCalaisAnnotator - an sample annotator using the OpenCalais Service
 - SnowballAnnotator - an annotator making use of the snowball stemmers
 - TikaAnnotator - an annotator using the Tika project text extractors
 
Additionally the package contains some components to package annotators 
and for accessing annotators as simple REST service. These are:
 - PearPackagingAntTask
 - SimpleServer

Finally, there is an addon to the base UIMA:
 - FsVariables
 
Each component has a separate LICENSE and NOTICE files;  some also 
have Readme and other documentation (in docs/). Documentation
is also available on the UIMA website, in the Sandbox area. 


3. Major Changes in this Release

The Apache UIMA annotator package release version 2.3.0 adds the  is the first release 
following components to the previously released ocmponents:

 - Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) BSFAnnotator
 - ConceptMapper
 - ConfigurableFeatureExtractor
 - Lucas - an interface to using UIMA with Lucene
 - OpenCalaisAnnotator - an sample annotator using the OpenCalais Service
 - SnowballAnnotator - an annotator making use of the snowball stemmers
 - TikaAnnotator - an annotator using the Tika project text extractors

The PearPackagingMavenPlugin is moved to the base UIMA release package.

The XMLBean support is migrated to version 2.4.0, and all of the projects
now use the maven xmlbeans plugin to generate the XML parsers.
 
Finally, there is an addon to the base UIMA:
 - FsVariables
