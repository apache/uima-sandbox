			The Dictionary Annotator (DictionaryAnnotator) is an
			Apache UIMA analysis engine that annotates words based on
			dictionary entries. For each detected word in the document text 
			which is available in the dictionary a new annotation is created.

			The annotator can be configured with one or more independent 
			dictionaries for the lookup. The dictionaries can be created easily with the
			provided dictionary creator command line tooling. For advanced usage
			of the annotator the matching can be improved by specifying 
			multi word capabilities, match input type properties and input type 
			filtering settings.

		<title>Processing Overview</title>
		<para>
			To work with the DictionaryAnnotator at first a dictionary must be 
			created. Out-of-the-box the annotator does not provide any dictionary.
			To create a dictionary you have to provide a list of dictionary entries
			to the dictionary creator which immediately creates a new dictionary.
			The created dictionary can now be used to configure the annotator to
			lookup words. For each dictionary the output type for the created
			annotation beside some other metadata capabilities can be configured.
			The dictionary is able to work with single word entries like "Apache" or with
			multi word entries like "Apache UIMA".
		</para>
		<para>
			After the annotator is configured with the created dictionary the lookup
			strategy settings must be defined. The dictionary lookup inside the annotator 
			is based on tokens.	Tokens are used to look for dictionary entries. The kind of 
			tokens that are used for the lookup can be configured and enhanced with
			filter capabilities. To improve the dictionary lookup the
			tokenization of the dictionary entries and the tokenization of the 
			document text should be the same. This can be achieved when using the
			dictionary creator with some advanced settings.
		</para>
		<para>
		    During the annotator processing for each word of the document text 
		    that is available in the dictionary a new annotation with the dictionary 
		    output type is created. These annotations can in a next step be used to do 
		    some further processing.
