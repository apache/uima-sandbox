 * Adding this annotation to your analysis engine description makes your component "sofa aware." The
 * base CAS delivered to "sofa aware" components has no explicit view associated with it. The logic
 * is that it is impossible to know the intent of a sofa aware component and it should use getView
 * as needed. You should therefore be aware that if you need to work with the "_InitialView" view,
 * then you must explicitly request it with a call like:
 * 
 * JCas initialView = jCas.getView(CAS.NAME_DEFAULT_SOFA);
 * 
 * This is because the base CAS that it passed into the process method to "sofa aware" components is
 * not the same as the "_InitialView". See how the following member variable is used to understand
 * why/how:
 * 
 * org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.impl.PrimitiveAnalysisEngine_impl. mSofaAware
