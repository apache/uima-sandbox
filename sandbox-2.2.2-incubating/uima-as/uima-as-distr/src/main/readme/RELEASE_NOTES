1. What is UIMA-AS?

UIMA Asynchronous Scaleout (AS) is an add-on to Apache UIMA that provides a set of capabilities
for achieving flexible scaleout.  It is a second generation design, replacing the
CPM and Vinci Services. The CPM and Vinci are still available and are not being deprecated, 
but new designs are encouraged to use UIMA-AS for scalability, and current designs 
reaching limitations may want to move to UIMA-AS.
  
UIMA-AS is integrated with the new flow controller architecture, and can be applied to
both primitive and aggregate analysis engines.

2. Major Changes in this Release

This is the first Apache release of UIMA-AS.  


3. How to Get Involved

The Apache UIMA project really needs and appreciates any contributions, 
including documentation help, source code and feedback.  If you are interested
in contributing, please visit http://incubator.apache.org/uima/get-involved.html.


4. How to Report Issues

The Apache UIMA project uses JIRA for issue tracking.  Please report any 
issues you find at http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/uima.
