The Apache UIMA annotator package is an add-on package for the base UIMA release.
The add-on package contains annotator components developed for Apache UIMA. The 
add-on package fits the Apache UIMA directory structure and adds a directory 
called "addons/annotator" that contains the following annotator components:
 - DictionaryAnnotator
 - RegularExpressionAnnotator
 - Tagger
 - WhitespaceTokenizer
 
Additionally the package contains some components to package annotators 
and to accessing annotators as simple REST service. These are:
 - PearPackagingAntTask
 - PearPackagingMavenPlugin
 - SimpleServer

Each component has a separate documentation with some usage information.

Apache UIMA is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily
a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does
indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
