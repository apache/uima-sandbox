When I was 21, I moved out from my&#10;parents' home into my first own appartment in order to study in a&#10;bigger city. My new home was in Lilienstraße 1 in 25334 Hamburg. But&#10;I realized quickly that life in a metropolis wasn't relaxed enough&#10;for me. So I decided to move into a smaller town. Now I'm a tenant&#10;with an elderly widow. We live in Bürgerstraße 2 in 63737 Heidelberg.&#10;I really like the smalltown flair and my studies at Heidelberg's&#10;notable university.&#10;"/>
