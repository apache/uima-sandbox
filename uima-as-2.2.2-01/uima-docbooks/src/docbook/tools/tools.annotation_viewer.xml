<chapter id="ugr.tools.annotation_viewer">
  <title>Annotation Viewer</title>
  
  <para>The <emphasis>Annotation Viewer</emphasis> is a tool for viewing analysis results
    that have been saved to your disk as <emphasis>external XML representations of the
    CAS</emphasis>. These are saved in a particular format called XMI. In the UIMA SDK, XML
    versions of CASes can be generated by:</para>
  
  <itemizedlist><listitem><para>Running the Document Analyzer (see <olink
      targetdoc="&uima_docs_tools;" targetptr="ugr.tools.doc_analyzer"/>, which
    saves an XML representations of the CAS to the specified output directory.</para>
    </listitem>
    
    <listitem><para>Running a Collection Processing Engine that includes the
      <emphasis>XMI Writer </emphasis>CAS Consumer
      (<literal>examples/descriptors/cas_consumer/XmiWriterCasConsumer.xml)</literal>.
      </para></listitem>
    
    <listitem><para>Explicitly creating XML representations of the CAS from your own
      application using the org.apache.uima.cas.impl.XMISerializer class. The best way
      to learn how to do this is to look at the example code for the XMI Writer CAS Consumer,
      located in
      <literal>examples/src/org/apache/uima/examples/xmi/XmiWriterCasConsumer.java</literal>.
      <footnote><para>An older form of a different XML format for the CAS is also provided
      mainly for backwards compatibility. This form is called XCAS, and you can see examples
      of its use in
      <literal>examples/src/org/apache/uima/examples/cpe/XCasWriterCasConsumer.java</literal>.
      </para></footnote> </para></listitem></itemizedlist>
  <note><para>The Annotation Viewer only shows CAS views where the Sofa data type is a String.
  </para></note>
  
  <para>You can run the Annotation Viewer by executing the
    <literal>annotationViewer</literal> shell script located in the bin directory of the
    UIMA SDK or the "UIMA Annotation Viewer" Eclipse run configuration in the
    <literal>uimaj-examples</literal> project. This will open the following window:   
    
    <screenshot>
  <mediaobject>
    <imageobject>
      <imagedata width="5.8in" format="JPG" fileref="&imgroot;image002.jpg"/>
    </imageobject>
    <textobject><phrase>Screenshot of annotationViewer</phrase></textobject>
  </mediaobject>
</screenshot></para>
  
  <para>Select an input directory (which must contain XMI files), and the descriptor for the
    AE that produced the Analysis (which is needed to get the type system for the analysis).
    Then press the <quote>View</quote> button.</para>
  
  <para>This will bring up a dialog where you can select a viewing format and double-click on a
    document to view it. This dialog is the same as the one that is described in <olink
      targetdoc="&uima_docs_tools;"
      targetptr="ugr.tools.doc_analyzer.viewing_results"/>.</para>
