This file contains some tips on how to create documentation using this docbook system.

Recommended editor = XMLBuddy plugin for Eclipse.  This will read the docbook dtd, 
plus any customized Entities you might declare, and make them available for 
Eclipse auto-completion and checking.

Entities you declare can be put into shared entity files, and then
essentially included in other files.  See Chapter 22 of the DocBook XSL, the 
Complete Guide, for examples.

NOTES:

The functionality for xi:include relative linking when the thing being included was 
in a different directory from the includer was broken.  
This showed up in image fileref= attributes being improperly / inconsistently translated
to src=... attributes in the generated xml.  Work-around: give up for now
in having subdirectories - put all things into one directory.

The qandaset functionality works but the FOP processor 0.20.5 seems to have trouble
handling id= attributes; it's giving an incorrect error message about a duplicate id tag,
when, in fact, there is no duplicate.  Work-around: give up using qandaset - just use
variablelist instead.

Parameters for Docbook are described in the FO ref:

body.start.indent fails on FOP - use title.margin.left instead
