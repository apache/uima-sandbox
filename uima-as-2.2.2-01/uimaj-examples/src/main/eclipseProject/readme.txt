The classpath and project files in this directory are those used by the
UIMA SDK build process to create a project that can be imported into Eclipse
by the user.  The build path is set to import external JARs using a UIMA_HOME
claspath variable.

Note these files don't start with dots here because that confuses Eclipse;
the dots are added by the build script.
