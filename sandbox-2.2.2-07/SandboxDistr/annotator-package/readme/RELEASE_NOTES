1. What is UIMA?

Unstructured Information Management applications are software systems that 
analyze large volumes of unstructured information in order to discover knowledge
that is relevant to an end user. UIMA is a framework and SDK for developing such
applications. An example UIM application might ingest plain text and identify 
entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or relations, such as 
works-for or located-at. UIMA enables such an application to be decomposed into 
components, for example "language identification" -> 
"language specific segmentation" -> "sentence boundary detection" -> 
"entity detection (person/place names etc.)". Each component must implement 
interfaces defined by the framework and must provide self-describing metadata 
via XML descriptor files. The framework manages these components and the data 
flow between them. Components are written in Java or C++; the data that 
flows between components is designed for efficient mapping between these 
languages. UIMA additionally provides capabilities to wrap components as 
network services, and can scale to very large volumes by replicating processing 
pipelines over a cluster of networked nodes.

Apache UIMA is an Apache-licensed open source implementation of the UIMA 
specification (that specification is, in turn, being developed concurrently by 
a technical committee within OASIS , a standards organization). We invite and 
encourage you to participate in both the implementation and specification 
efforts.

UIMA is a component framework for analysing unstructured content such as text, 
audio and video. It comprises an SDK and tooling for composing and running 
analytic components written in Java and C++, with some support for Perl, 
Python and TCL.

2. What is the Apache UIMA annotator package?

The Apache UIMA annotator package is an add-on package for the base UIMA release.
The add-on package contains annotator components developed for Apache UIMA. The 
add-on package fits the Apache UIMA directory structure and adds a directory 
called "addons/annotator" that contains the following annotator components:
 - DictionaryAnnotator
 - RegularExpressionAnnotator
 - Tagger
 - WhitespaceTokenizer


3. Major Changes in this Release

The Apache UIMA annotator package release version 2.2.2 is the first release 
of this package. The package contains the following components:
 - DictionaryAnnotator
 - RegularExpressionAnnotator
 - Tagger
 - WhitespaceTokenizer
 - SimpleServer
 - PearPackagingAntTask
 - PearPackagingMavenPlugin
For a list of all JIRA issues fixed with the current Sandbox release, 
please refer to chapter 6. "List of JIRA Issues Fixed in this Release". 


4. How to Get Involved

The Apache UIMA project really needs and appreciates any contributions, 
including documentation help, source code and feedback.  If you are interested
in contributing, please visit http://incubator.apache.org/uima/get-involved.html.


5. How to Report Issues

The Apache UIMA project uses JIRA for issue tracking.  Please report any 
issues you find at http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/uima.
