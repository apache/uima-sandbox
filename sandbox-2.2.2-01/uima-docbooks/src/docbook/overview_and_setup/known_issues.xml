    <term><emphasis role="bold">Sun Java 1.4.2_12 doesn't serialize CR characters to XML</emphasis></term>
        <listitem>
        <para>The XML serialization support in Sun Java 1.4.2_12 doesn't serialize CR characters to 
        XML. As a result, if the document text contains CR characters, XCAS or XMI serialization 
        will cause them to be lost, resulting in incorrect annotation offsets. This is exposed in 
        the DocumentAnalyzer, with the highlighting being incorrect if the input document contains 
        CR characters. </para>

      <term><emphasis role="bold">JCasGen merge facility supports Java levels 1.4 or earlier</emphasis></term>
      <listitem>
        <para>JCasGen has a facility to merge in user (hand-coded) changes with the code generated
          by JCasGen.  This merging supports Java 1.4 constructs only.  JCasGen generates Java 1.4 
          compliant code, so as long as any code you change here also only uses Java 1.4 constructs, the 
      merge will work, even if you're using Java 5 or later.  
          If you use syntactic structures particular to Java 5 or later, the merge
        operation will likely fail to merge properly.</para>

      <term><emphasis role="bold">Descriptor editor in Eclipse tooling does not work with libgcj 4.1.2</emphasis></term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The descriptor editor in the Eclipse tooling does not work with libgcj 4.1.2, and
        possibly other versions of libgcj.  This is apparently due to a bug in the implementation of
        their XML library, which results in a class cast error.  libgcj is used as the default
        JVM for Eclipse in Ubuntu (and other Linux distributions?).  The workaround is to use a
        different JVM to start Eclipse.</para>
