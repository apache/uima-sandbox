The Apache UIMA annotator package is an add-on package for the base UIMA release.
The add-on package contains annotator components developed for Apache UIMA. The 
add-on package fits the Apache UIMA directory structure and adds a directory 
called "addons/annotator" that contains the following annotator components:
 - DictionaryAnnotator
 - RegularExpressionAnnotator
 - Tagger
 - WhitespaceTokenizer
 - Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) BSFAnnotator
 - ConceptMapper
 - ConfigurableFeatureExtractor
 - Lucas - an interface to using UIMA with Lucene
 - OpenCalaisAnnotator - an sample annotator using the OpenCalais Service
 - SnowballAnnotator - an annotator making use of the snowball stemmers
 - TikaAnnotator - an annotator using the Tika project text extractors
 
Additionally the package contains some components to package annotators 
and for accessing annotators as simple REST service. These are:
 - PearPackagingAntTask
 - SimpleServer

Finally, there is an addon to the base UIMA:
 - FsVariables
 
Each component has a separate LICENSE and NOTICE files;  some also 
have Readme and other documentation (in docs/).

Apache UIMA is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily
a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does
indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
