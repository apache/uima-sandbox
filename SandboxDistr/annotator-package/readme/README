     ----------------------------------------------------------------

The Apache UIMA annotator package is an add-on package for the base UIMA release.
The add-on package contains annotator components developed for Apache UIMA. The 
add-on package fits the Apache UIMA directory structure and adds a directory 
called "addons/annotator" that contains the following annotator components:
 - DictionaryAnnotator
 - RegularExpressionAnnotator
 - Tagger
 - WhitespaceTokenizer
 - Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) BSFAnnotator
 - ConceptMapper
 - ConfigurableFeatureExtractor
 - Lucas - an interface to using UIMA with Lucene
 - OpenCalaisAnnotator - an sample annotator using the OpenCalais Service
 - SnowballAnnotator - an annotator making use of the snowball stemmers
 - TikaAnnotator - an annotator using the Tika project text extractors
 
Additionally the package contains some components to package annotators 
and for accessing annotators as simple REST service. These are:
 - PearPackagingAntTask
 - SimpleServer

Finally, there is an addon to the base UIMA:
 - FsVariables
 
Each component has a separate LICENSE and NOTICE files;  some also 
have Readme and other documentation (in docs/). Documentation
is also available on the UIMA website, in the Sandbox area.

Apache UIMA is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily
a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does
indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
