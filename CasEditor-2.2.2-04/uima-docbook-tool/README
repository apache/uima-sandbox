		      UIMA DocBook Framework
		      ==========================

The docbook tooling used to produce the UIMA DocBooks is
based on work done by the Velocity project, where it
started out as a framework to render documentation for
the Velocity project (http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/) and ended
somehow up to be a generic framework to render DocBook documents using
Java and driven by ant.

The Velocity developers wrote:

While DocBook format seems to be ubiquitous these days, to my surprise
there were not many generic frameworks around that could render all
kinds of formats using Java and be easily customizable. Projects
either use heavily customized and hacked style sheets or a mix of Java
and other applications. Adjusting such a rendering framework to the
needs of the Velocity project wasn't easy, so at some point, we decided
to redo this (almost) from scratch.

This framework and documentation was originally written by the Jakarta Velocity
Developers. It has been extensively modified by the UIMA developers.
The tool framework has been moved out of this project and into 
the uima-docbook-tool project.

please contact the UIMA developers through the UIMA Development Mailing
list at uima-dev@incubator.apache.org


Why another framework for rendering docbook?
============================================

What we wanted to have, was a framework, that

* Renders multiple documents into multiple formats with an uniform look
  without having to copy a large number of stylesheets, images and other
  supporting files around

* Uses the standard DocBook XML and XSL zip files available for
  download. Many of the open source DocBook framework use heavily
  hacked versions and we want to be able to keep up with releases
  without having to patch the released files every time.

* Use current versions of the DocBook reference files, the libraries
  and supporting tools. 

* Render all formats without connecting to the Internet. Using 
  the Apache XML resolver it should be possible to use the framework
  completely standalone. See
  http://xml.apache.org/commons/components/resolver/resolver-article.html
  for an explanation.

* has some documentation so you understand what happens when a format
  gets rendered and how. That can be customized easily (if you consider
  customizing complex XSL style sheets 'easy' :-) )

* 100% pure Java. No external programs needed or called.

* ant-driven, platform independent.

  UIMA developers added these:
  
* supports XInclude - so you can break up your book into individual
  svn-controlled chapters, and xinclude them with a master file into
  a book
  
* supports the Docbook "olink" mechanism 

* supports multiple Docbooks

* shares images among html and htmlsingle formats (images are often the
  most memory consuming part of the document)
  
* automatically scale images for html vs pdf so they appear the same size


What you need
=============

* The uima-docbook-tool project (from the UIMA svn)

* A Java Runtime. All testing has been done using the Sun JSDK 1.5.0
  and 1.6.0
  but Java 1.4.2 has also been used quite extensively.

* Apache Ant version 1.6 or better. The build script uses the macrodef
  task which was introduced in ant 1.6. Get it from http://ant.apache.org/

* If you want to render images, Java Advanced Imaging (see README.FIRST)


How it is used
==============

The documents to render are located in src/docbook. 
Each book is in one subdirectory.  The name of the subdirectory
is up to you, but this name appears in many other places (by convention).
The name should be unique to this installation of this pacakge.

The subdirectory can contain 1 or more files, and an images subdirectory.
Image subdirectory names must be unique for this installation of this package, 
because they're all put into one target directory (to permit sharing of 
docbook images).
If you have more than one file, you can use a modular approach where one 
file (by convention of the same name as the book subdirectory, followed by ".xml")
is the "master file" and includes the <book> docbook element, and uses XIncludes 
to include other parts (typically chapters).

Parallel to the book subdirectories is another set of directories under src/olink.
These contain for each book the generated olink databases needed for cross reference
linking using the docbook olink mechanism.  See the Olink section for more details.
These olink files should be saved in the source svn tree because they're needed for
the rebuilding of the targets.

If you run ant in the base directory of this distribution, it should
build a target directory in target/ for each directory in
src/docbook. In each of the directories, you'll find two
outputs for the single html (called by the book-name.html)
and the pdf (called by the book-name.pdf).

In addition, the target directory has 
   - a shared images directory (the images
     associated with docbook itself are shared among all books).
   - a css directory for each book

Zip files are not created here - a further packaging step can create these
if needed.  


Running Ant from Eclipse
========================

If you run ant with no arguments in the base directory, it runs the
build.xml ant script which builds all the UIMA documentation.


Notes
=====

* Changing the paper size

  The docbook framework renders its pages in "Letter" format
  (8.5 x 11 inches).  This allows printing in both, Letter and A4
  format. If you want to reformat the PDF documentation in A4, you
  can use the 'paper.type' parameter:

  ant -Dpaper.type=A4 will render the documentation in A4.


Add a new DocBook "book"
========================

Create a new subdirectory inside src/docbook. In there goes your
new docbook document. If you need images for your document, they go
into src/<bookname>/images/<maybe-subdir-for-chapter>/<image-name>.png etc. 
Inside your document, they should be referenced as
'..images/etc.' because images are kept one level highter in the target
for sharing the docbook images.

In the main build.xml file, you must add a call to the build-all-books
task for your new document:

<ant antfile="build-docbook.xml" target="all">
      <property name="book_name" value="tutorials_and_users_guides"/>  (1)
</ant>

(1) This is the subdirectory in src/docbook

If you want to do just one chapter of a book, you can.  Do it like this:

<ant antfile="build-docbook.xml" target="all">
      <property name="book_name" value="tutorials_and_users_guides"/>
      <property name="chapter_name" value="tug.cas_multiplier"/>
</ant>

When you add a new document to the framework, you must make sure that
its referenced DocBook DTD files can be resolved by the Catalog
resolver. Currently, the resolver knows about DocBook 4.5 and 4.4, so your
document declaration should be

<!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.5//EN"
       "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.5/docbookx.dtd">

(or, if you're using an older level of docbook:
<!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.4//EN"
       "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.4/docbookx.dtd">

If you use another doctype definition, the framework will still work,
but connect to the Internet to get the definition files every time you
run the build process.


How to write / edit Docbook source
==================================

If you are comfortable with Eclipse, obtain the XMLBuddy plugin for it
and use it.  It integrates into the Eclipse auto-complete framework all the
docbook elements and attributes.  It also "knows about" any "entities" that you
might define/declare.  The UIMA Docbook source makes extensive use of these -
using entities this way will show an error indicator if you mispell it, and
entities also participate in the auto-complete framework.  And, when you're
all done, click on the menu "XML" -> "format" and the source is nicely
formatted for you.

You can also use XMLMind (see the bottom of this document), but it doesn't
support entities.


How it works (in depth)
=======================

ant files
---------

The build.xml file contains only the driver targets for rendering the
documentation.  It imports the main build file from the uima-docbook-took
project - the build-docbook.xml. This file normally should not be changed; if you
have to, please let the developers know, so we can incorporate your
changes and or bug fixes into the main distribution.

build-docbook.xml contains three main targets: pdf, html and
htmlsingle. Each is responsible for rendering one format.

User configurable settings are done using the local.docbook.properties
file, which needs to be at the top level of the project.

DocBook reference files
-----------------------

The uima-docbook-tool project uses the DocBook XML and XSL distribution archives
without any changes to them. The version number needs to be in the
local.docbook.properties files.  


XML Resolver
------------

The framework uses the Apache XML commons resolver to avoid accessing
the Internet for DTD files. The resolver is configured through the
CatalogManager.properties and xml-catalog.xml files in the uima-docbook-tool/catalog
configuration files. If you update e.g. the Docbook XML
version, you must also update the catalog file to match the new
version.


Docbook Source files
--------------------

The sources for each DocBook document to render should be in
src/docbook. Each document has its own subdirectory and gets rendered
separately. Adding a new document is described in "Adding a new
DocBook document" above.


Stylesheets and Driver files
----------------------------

For each of the formats used by the framework, a stylesheet driver
file exists in src/styles. These files are pdf.xsl, html.xsl and
htmlsingle.xsl.

The driver files are intended to reference the actual style sheet
customization and to add some framework specific elements through
filtering. This two step process has been chosen because html and
htmlsingle are very similar and it makes no sense to maintain two sets
of stylesheet customizations that are virtually identical.


StyleSheet customizations
-------------------------

These customizations are located in subdirectories in
src/styles. Currently there are only two: pdf and html (html and
htmlsingle use the same set of customizations). They are referenced
from the driver files as src/styles/<subdirectory>/custom.xsl.


PDF StyleSheet information
--------------------------

In the footer, the <releaseinfo> and <productname> elements of the
DocBook document are displayed. Each document should have these fields
defined.


Titlepages
----------

PDF and HTML use custom title pages. These are located in the
respecting src/styles subdirectories as titlepage.xml template
definitions. The build process renders these files using the DocBook
XSL template/titlepage.xsl Stylesheet into the same directory
as the source.  This
style sheet then must be included in the style sheet driver file (see
the driver files in src/styles, e.g. pdf.xsl).

If the titlepage reference a project logo, it should be saved 
as 'logo.png' in the src/images directory. It gets rendered on both
the HTML and PDF title pages.


HTML CSS
--------

There is support for a CSS file in the html and htmlsingle render
process. This file is defined in the HTML customization file
(src/styles/html/custom.xsl) and must be located in the src/css/html
directory. It is copied into a css subdirectory in the target and must
be referenced as css/<filename>. See the HTML customization file and
the build-docbook.xml on how this is done.

Currently, only a single style sheet is supported for both html and
htmlsingle.


Acknowledgements
----------------

DocBook is a fairly complex format and using and customizing the XSL
style sheets available is not really straightforward. So by googling
left and right and looking at other DocBook rendering frameworks that
are in the open source, we tried to model similarities and sometimes
actually copied some of the ideas.

This DocBook framework is literally standing on the shoulders of other
projects, in particular:

* The Docbook project from Apache Velocity

* The DocBook Format by Norman Walsh; (C) 1999-2006 by Norman Walsh,
  OASIS and O'Reilly, especially all the documentation that is
  available from http://www.docbook.org/

* The DocBook FAQ maintained by Dave Pawson. We wouldn't have survived
  without that. (http://www.dpawson.co.uk/docbook/)

* DocBook XSL: The Complete Guide by Bob Stayton. This is an invaluable
  reference to the DocBook style sheets. Find it online at
  http://sagehill.net/ or buy the E-book.

* The DocBook Project located at http://docbook.sourceforge.net/. They
  maintain the XSL style sheets used to transform DocBook into
  other formats and also link to the docbook mailing list archives.

* The Apache XML commons resolver from
  http://xml.apache.org/commons/components/resolver/

Ideas on how to render elements, to arrange things and how to do more
obscure things like title pages or use CSS to render HTML, I've taken
(sometimes literally by cut'n'paste) from

* The Spring Framework documentation. This is how we got hooked on the
  idea that Velocity should have DocBook documentation, too. Their
  DocBook framework is really nice, however for my needs it proved to
  be 'not exactly what we was looking for' (see above).

  Spring is IMHO an example that good documentation makes all the
  difference between a successful and popular project and 'the
  others'. Thanks a lot, Spring guys!

* The "ant and docbook" styler suite by Dawid Weiss, available from
  http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/dweiss/xml/projects/ant-docbook-styler/index.xml
. We stole his CSS style sheet almost verbatim. Thanks a lot, Dawid! 

* The Maven sdocbook plugin by Siegfried Goeschl, Per Olesen and
  Carlos Sanchez, available at the SourceForge Maven plugin page
  at http://maven-plugins.sourceforge.net/maven-sdocbook-plugin/

* The XMLmind XML Editor from http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/
  This is a cross-platform, pure Java editor that not only runs well
  on Linux, Windows and MacOS but also offers DocBook WYSIWYG support
  and has a free version. And if you pay for it, you get the source
  code for it too.
