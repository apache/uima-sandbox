		<title>Introduction</title>
		<para>
			ConceptMapper is a token-based dictionary lookup UIMA component. It was
			designed specifically to allow any external tokenizer that is a UIMA
			component to be used to tokenize its dictionary. Using the same tokenizer
			on both the dictionary and for subsequent text processing prevents
			situations where a particular dictionary entry is not found, though it
			exists, because it was tokenized differently than the text being processed.
			
			ConceptMapper is highly configurable, in terms of:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						the way dictionary entries are mapped to resultant annotations
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						the way input documents are processed
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						the availability of multiple lookup strategies
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						its various output options
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>			
			Additionally, a set of post-processing filters are supplied, as well as an
			interface to easily create new filters. This allows for overgenerating
			results during the lookup phase, if so desired, then reducing the result
			set according to particular rules.
