There are 4 "books" in this package:

1. An intro / overview / and Eclipse Setup instructions, with FAQ and Glossary

2. A set of tutorials and developer's guides

3. Tools user's guides

4. References

Each book is available as an HTML file, and as a PDF (for printing).  Both of these are enabled for
cross referencing, within each book and across the set of books.

   For the PDF files, clicking on the cross references that cross book boundaries only
   works when the PDF is browsed from within a browser like Internet Explorer (tested
   with IE6 and Adobe Acrobat version 8); it 
   doesn't properly link if the document being linked from is being viewed just using
   the Adobe Acrobat reader (not in a browser).  This is a know limitation of the Acrobat
   Reader.  If you want/need to do this, please use the HTML version.
