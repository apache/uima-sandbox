For instructions on building Apache UIMA please refer to:
http://incubator.apache.org/uima/svn.html#building.with.maven

If you have installed both the Apache UIMA binary distribution and the
Apache UIMA source distribution, you can run the addSourceJars.bat 
(or .sh) script to add the source code to the jar files in the 
UIMA_HOME/lib directory.  This may make it more convenient to access
the UIMA Source Code (and JavaDocs) from an IDE such as Eclipse.

See the NOTICE file for licensing information.

Apache UIMA is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily
a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does
indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
