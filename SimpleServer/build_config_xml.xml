	         would be only one simple server jar.  However, xbeans creates a .class file as part
	         of its output, and I was unable to figure out how to get Eclipse to deal with this.
	         Checking in a .class file in a source folder works fine for maven, but not for
	         Eclipse.  And maybe it's not such a good idea after all.  So, back to a separate jar
	         for the xbean stuff.  -->
