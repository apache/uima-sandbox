  <title>Introduction</title>
  
  <para>The UIMA Simple Server makes results of UIMA processing available in a simple, XML-based
  format.  The intended use of the the Simple Server is to provide UIMA analysis as a REST service.
  The Simple Server is implemented as a Java Servlet, and can be deployed into any Servlet container
  (such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty).</para>
  
  <para>Once you have installed the Simple Server into a Servlet container of your choice, you can
  make your UIMA analysis available as follows:
  </para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
  <para>Package you analysis as a UIMA PEAR file</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>Create a mapping file that tells the server what analysis results to show in which format</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>Deploy the PEAR file and the mapping file into the server.</para>
  </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>In the following, we will explain how to perform each of these steps.  We will also show
  you how to accomplish all of this in a concrete Servlet container, namely Apache Tomcat.  Finally,
  we will describe how to use another Servlet container, Jetty, to test your application 
  <emphasis>without</emphasis> deployment.</para>
  
  <section>
  <title>Quick start for the impatient</title>
  <para>If you're familiar with UIMA and servlets, you can start right here and get your first
  simple service running in a few minutes.  If not, not to worry.  We'll go over this in much more
  detail later on.  To follow the quick start guide, you will need to have:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
  <para>Tomcat or some other servlet container installed.  Installing Tomcat is a breeze, see 
  <ulink url="http://tomcat.apache.org/"></ulink>. </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>The UIMA development environment set up (with Maven and all the other good stuff).  For
  information on how to do that, see <ulink url="http://incubator.apache.org/uima/svn.html"></ulink>.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>Doing all this from Eclipse is convenient, but not required.  If you work with Eclipse, the
  Sysdeo Tomcat plugin is useful: <ulink url="http://www.eclipsetotale.com/tomcatPlugin.html"></ulink>.
  It lets you start and stop Tomcat from Eclipse, and allows you to debug your web apps in the
  Eclipse debugger.</para>
  </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <section>
  <title>Install the SimpleServer code</title>
  
  <para>If you haven't done so already, start by extracting the SimpleServer sandbox project from
  Subversion, and build it with "mvn install".  Copy the following files to the <code>shared/lib</code>
  directory of your servlet container (i.e., Tomcat most likely; if the directory doesn't exist,
  you can create it):
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
  <para><code>SimpleServer/lib/config-xml.jar</code>
  </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><code>SimpleServer/lib/jsr173_1.0_api.jar</code>
  </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><code>SimpleServer/lib/xbean.jar</code>
  </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><code>SimpleServer/target/uimaj-simple-server.jar</code>
  </para>
  </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>
  One more file you need to copy there is <code>uima-core.jar</code>.  You can either build it from
  source, or grab it from the <code>lib</code> directory of an Apache UIMA distribution.  Note: the
  SimpleServer requires at least version 2.2.1 of UIMA.
  </para>
  
  </section>
  
  <section>
  <title>Build the WhitespaceTokenizer</title>
  
  <para>Extract the WhitespaceTokenizer sandbox project from Subversion and build it with "mvn install".
  Note that the WhitespaceTokenizer depends on the PearPackagingMavenPlugin sandbox project, so you
  will need to extract and build that one as well.
  </para>
  
  <para>When you have successfully built the WhitespaceTokenizer, you'll end up with a pear file in
  <code>WhitespaceTokenizer/target/WhitespaceTokenizer.pear</code>.  You'll need this file in the
  next step.
  </para>
  
  </section>
  
  <section>
  <title>Create a UIMA webapp</title>
  
  <para>Create a subdirectory <code>webapps/uima</code> in your Tomcat directory.  This is where all
  your simple services will live.  Now create further subdirectories <code>webapps/uima/resources</code>
  and <code>webapps/uima/WEB-INF</code> (webapp metadata) and <code>webapps/uima/resources</code>
  (UIMA analysis).
  </para>
  
  <para>Copy the whitespace tokenizer pear file from your workspace
  (<code>WhitespaceTokenizer/target/WhitespaceTokenizer.pear</code>) to <code>webapps/uima/resources</code>
  in your Tomcat directory.  Copy a corresponding SimpleServer output mapping file 
  <code>SimpleServer/src/main/resources/samples/WhitespaceTokenizer.xml</code> also to 
  <code>webapps/uima/resources</code>.
  </para>
  
  <para>Finally, copy <code>SimpleServer/src/main/resources/samples/web.xml</code> to
  <code>webapps/uima/WEB-INF</code>.
  </para>
  
  </section>
  
  <section>
  <title>Trying it out</title>
  
  <para>This is it, your first simple service should be ready to run.  Start (or restart) Tomcat and
  direct your browser to the following URL: <ulink url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/uima/ws-tokenizer?mode=form"></ulink>.
  Type in some text, check the "inline XML" radio button, and hit "Submit Query".  You should see
  your text split up into sentences and tokens.
