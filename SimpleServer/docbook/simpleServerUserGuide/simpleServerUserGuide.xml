  <title>Introduction</title>
  
  <para>The UIMA Simple Server makes results of UIMA processing available in a simple, XML-based
  format.  The intended use of the the Simple Server is to provide UIMA analysis as a REST service.
  The Simple Server is implemented as a Java Servlet, and can be deployed into any Servlet container
  (such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty).</para>
  
  <para>Once you have installed the Simple Server into a Servlet container of your choice, you can
  make your UIMA analysis available as follows:
  </para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
  <para>Package you analysis as a UIMA PEAR file</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>Create a mapping file that tells the server what analysis results to show in which format</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>Deploy the PEAR file and the mapping file into the server.</para>
  </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>In the following, we will explain how to perform each of these steps.  We will also show
  you how to accomplish all of this in a concrete Servlet container, namely Apache Tomcat.  Finally,
  we will describe how to use another Servlet container, Jetty, to test your application 
  <emphasis>without</emphasis> deployment.</para>
