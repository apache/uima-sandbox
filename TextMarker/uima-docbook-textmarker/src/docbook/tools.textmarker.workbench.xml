  <title>TextMarker Workbench</title>
  <para>
  The TextMarker workbench, which is made available as an Eclipse-
  plugin, offers a powerful environment for creating and working on TextMarker projects. It provides two main
  perspectives and several views to develop, run, debug, test and evaluate TextMarker
  rules in a comfortable way, supporting many of the known Eclipse features e.g. auto-completion.
  Moreover it makes the creation of dictionaries like tree word lists easy and supports machine
  learning methods which can be used within a knowledge engineering process. The following chapter
  starts with the installation of the workbench, followed by a description of all its features.
