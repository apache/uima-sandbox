	<title>TextMarker Perspective</title>
	<para>
		The TextMarker perspective is the main view to manage TextMarker
		projects. There are several views associated with the TextMarker
		perspective: Annotation Test, Annotation Browser, Selection,
		TextRuler, TextMarker Query. Since Annotation Test, TextRuler and
		TextMarker Query have a stand-alone functionality they are explained
		in separate sections.
	</para>

	<para>
		To make it possible to reproduce all of the examples used below,
		switch to the TextMarker Explain perspective within your Eclipse
		workbench.
		Import the TextMarker example project and open the main
		TextMarker script file 'Main.tm'. Now press the 'Run' button (green
		arrow)and wait for the end of execution. Open the resulting xmiCAS
		file
		'Test1.txt.xmi', which you can find in the output folder.
	</para>

	<section
		id="section.ugr.tools.tm.workbench.tm_perspective.annotation_browser">
		<title>Annotation Browser</title>
		<para>
			The Annotation Browser can be used to view the annotations
			created by the execution of a TextMarker project. If an xmiCAS file
			is opened and active in the editor, the related annotations are shown
			in this view.
		</para>
		<para>
			The result of the execution of the TextMarker example project is
			shown in
			<xref
				linkend='figure.ugr.tools.tm.workbench.tm_perspective.annotation_browser' />
			.
		</para>
		<para>
			<figure

		</para>
		<para>
			Moreover, this view has two possible filters. Using the
			<quote>Only types with...</quote>
			-filter lead to a list containing only those types that contain
			the
			entered text. The
			<quote>Only annotations with...</quote>
			-filter leads to an analog list.
		</para>

	<section id="section.ugr.tools.tm.workbench.tm_perspective.selection">
		<title>Selection</title>
		<para>
			The Selection view is very similar to the Annotation Browser
			view, but only shows annotations that affect a specific text passage.
			To get such a list, click on any position in the opened xmiCAS
			document or select a certain text passage.
		</para>
		<para>
			E.g., if you select the text passage
			<literal>2008</literal>
			, the Selection view will be generated as shown in
			<xref
				linkend='figure.ugr.tools.tm.workbench.tm_perspective.annotation_browser' />
			.

		</para>
		<para>
			The Selection view has the same filtering possibilities as
			described in Annotation Browser view.
