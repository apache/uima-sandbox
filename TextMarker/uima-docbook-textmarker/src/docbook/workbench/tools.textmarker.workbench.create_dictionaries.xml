  <title>Creation of Tree Word Lists</title>
  <para>
    Tree word lists are external resources which can be used
    to annotate
    all occurrences of list items in a document
    with a given annotation
    type very fast. For more details
    on their use, see
    <xref linkend='ugr.tools.tm.language.external_resources' />
    . Since simple tree and multi tree word lists have to be compiled
    the
    TextMarker workbench provides an easy way to compile
    them from ordinary
    text files. These text files have to
    containing one item per line, for
    example like in the
    following list of first names:
    <programlisting><![CDATA[Frank
Peter
Jochen
Martin
]]></programlisting>
  </para>
  <para>
    To compile a simple tree word list from a text file,
    right-click on the text file in TextMarker script
    explorer. You get the menu seen in
    <xref linkend='figure.ugr.tools.tm.workbench.create_dictionaries_1' />
    .

    <figure id="figure.ugr.tools.tm.workbench.create_dictionaries_1">
      <title> The views Matched Rules and Failed Rules
      </title>

        </imageobject>
        <textobject>
          <phrase>
            The Rule Elements view.
          </phrase>
        </textobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>
  </para>
  <para>
    When hovering over TextMarker item you can choose
    <quote>Convert to TWL</quote>
    .
    Click on it and a tree word list with the same name as the origin
    file is
    generated in the same folder.
  </para>
  <para>
    You can also generate several tree word lists at once. To do so,
    just select
    multiple files and then right-click and do the same as for a single
    list. You will get one tree word list for every selected file.
  </para>
  <para>
    To generate a multi tree work list, select all files which should be
    generated
    into the multi tree word list. Again right-click and select
    <quote>Convert to Multi TWL</quote>
    under item TextMarker. A multi tree word list
    named
    <quote>generated.mtwl</quote>
    will be created.
