For instructions on building Apache UIMA-AS please refer to:
http://incubator.apache.org/uima/svn.html#building.with.maven

Those instructions will enable building the uima core, which is
needed by this project.

To build this project, first build the UIMA core, and then
do the following steps:

1) either check out of SVN the following projects into the same 
"workspace" directory that you checked out the base UIMA:
   - uima-as-distr
   - uimaj-as
   - uimaj-as-activemq
   - uimaj-as-core
   - uimaj-as-jms
   - uimaj-ep-deployeditor
   - uimaj-ep-runtime-deployeditor
   
   or, unzip the source distribution into the same workspace.
   
2) cd to the uimaj-as project, and do mvn install
3) To work with eclipse, following step 2), do mvn eclipse:eclipse
4) To build the distribution, follow the setup instructions on
http://incubator.apache.org/uima/svn.html#build.distribution and 
then cd to uima-as-distr and do mvn assembly:assembly

-------------------------

If you have installed both the Apache UIMA-AS binary distribution and the
Apache UIMA-AS source distribution, you can run the addSourceJars.bat 
(or .sh) script to add the source code to the jar files in the 
UIMA_HOME/lib directory.  This may make it more convenient to access
the UIMA Source Code (and JavaDocs) from an IDE such as Eclipse.

See the NOTICE file for licensing information.

Apache UIMA is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily
a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does
indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
