fsvars_index_doesnt_exist = The FsVariable index "{0}" doesn't exist.  The index needs to be created in \
        some analysis engine descriptor.  See the FsVariable documentation for more information.
        
fsvars_type_doesnt_exist = The FsVariable type "{0}" doesn't exist.  The type needs to be declared \
        in some analysis engine descriptor.  See the FsVariable documentation for more information.
        
fsvars_feature_doesnt_exist = The FsVariable feature "{0}" doesn't exist.  The type needs to be declared \
        in some analysis engine descriptor.  See the FsVariable documentation for more information.
        
fsvars_variable_already_defined = The FsVariable "{0}" has already been defined.

no_such_fsvar = No FsVariable "{0}" exists.

bad_typename_in_fsvar = Bad FsVariable type "{0}" in variable "{1}".

illegal_fsvar_value = Trying to assign FS of type "{0}" to FsVariable "{1}" of type "{2}".  This is \
        invalid, as "{2}" does not subsume "{0}".
