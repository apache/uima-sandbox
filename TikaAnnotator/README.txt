Apache UIMA TikaAnnotator README file

INTRODUCTION

Apache Tika is a toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata 
and structured text content from various documents 
using existing parser libraries. 

TikaAnnotator uses Tika to generate annotations representing 
the original markup of a document, extract its text and metadata. 
It consists of three resources (see /desc):

- FileSystemCollectionReader : similar to the one in UIMA examples but uses 
  TIKA to extract the text from binary documents and generates annotations 
  to represent the markup
- MarkupAnnotator : takes the original content from a view and generates 
  a new view containing the extracted text with markup annotations
- TikaWrapper : utility class which allows to populate a CAS 
  from a binary document; used by the FileSystemCollectionReader

COMPILATION 

You can use the ANT script to compile the sources. 
Note that you need to add the Tika-jars in the /lib directory; 
it is recommended to use the Tika-*-standalone.jar 
which contains all the libraries used internally by Tika.
