    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      The RDF CAS Consumer is a component to create RDF files from
      CAS objects.
    </para>
    <para>
      RDF CAS Consumer uses Apache Clerezza RDF serializing
      capabilities and its integration modules with UIMA to create
      files in various RDF formats from the CAS object.

    <title>Configuration</title>
    <para>
      To configure the RDFCASConsumer there are 3 parameters that can be set.
      The parameters 'file' and 'format' are mandatory while 'view' is optional.
      With the 'file' parameter the output file has to be specified using the file
      protocol (i.e.: file://pathto/file.rdf).
    </para>
    <para>
      The 'format' parameter handles the output format as there are different options
      provided by the Serializer specified. Since RDFCASConsumer takes advantage of the
      Apache Clerezza serializing facilities it depends on which serializer is enabled;
      by default only the org.apache.clerezza.rdf.jena.serializer artifact is used but,
      as Clerezza offers different serializing options, it can be extended to handle more
      file formats. With org.apache.clerezza.rdf.jena.serializer the following formats are
      supported: application/rdf+xml, text/turtle, application/x-turtle, text/rdf+nt and
      text/rdf+n3.
    </para>
    <para>
      Finally with the 'view' parameter the particular CAS View to serialize can be specified.
      If no view is defined then the current default CAS view is serialized as RDF.
    </para>
