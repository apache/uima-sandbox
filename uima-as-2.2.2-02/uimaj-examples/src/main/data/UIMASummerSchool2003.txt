UIMA Summer School Tutorial and Presentation Details
UIMA 101: The new UIMA tutorial  
Tuesday August 26 9:00AM - 4:30PM in GN-K35

UIMA 101 is a hands-on programming tutorial.

UIMA 101 is intended for people who want a first introductory course to UIMA or for people who would like a refresher.

The tutorial covers the same concepts in the first UIMA tutorial given in 3Q 2002 except for some key updates:

1) It uses a new interface to the CAS that makes it more natural to access and update CAS feature structures using ordinary Java objects (i.e., the JCAS) and
2) It uses updated TAE interfaces that give the application developer more control over managing multiple CASs. 

Please NOTE expert users of UIMA can skip this one and should consider attending the Advanced Topics tutorial.

Prerequisites for the UIMA 101 Tutorial
1) Java Programming
2) Some experience with Eclipse IDE helpful

In this talk we will explain the service and what it is intended to provide the UIMA community. We will address the following topics:

1. SITH Services
2. How to submit components and what to expect in return
3. Overview of the test bed implementation using Collection Processing UIMA and Juru. 
4. Next Steps for the SITH
